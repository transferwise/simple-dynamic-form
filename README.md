# Simple Dynamic Form
This is the commented code (frontend and backend) on building your own dynamic form.
This code is purposely made to run without any additional dependencies (apart from what comes as part of node.js) to demonstrate that it can be done on almost any language and any framework.

## Dependencies (backend)
- http - To create a http webserver
- fs - To serve the `index.html` file

# How to run
1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Run command `node index.js`
3. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8080`
